Extra Advice
At the end of each day, write down one thing you struggled with and how you solved it — this makes it stick.
If you get stuck, don’t ask AI for the full answer. Instead, ask: “I tried this code but it’s not working. Can you explain what’s wrong?”
Keep all your files in one folder — it’s proof of your progress.
